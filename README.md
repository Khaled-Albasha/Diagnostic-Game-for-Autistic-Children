# Diagnostic Game for Autistic Children

This project aims to develop a game-based assessment tool for assisting in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children.  The game provides a more accessible, engaging, and child-friendly experience compared to traditional diagnostic methods, while gathering valuable data on children's behaviors and developmental skills.

## Getting Started

This game is designed for Android devices (version 7 or later) and requires an internet connection.

### Prerequisites

* Android device (version 7 or later)
* Internet connection

### Installation

1. Download the game files from the Itch.io page.
2. Run the game on your Android device.

## How to Play

The game consists of five levels, each designed to assess different aspects of development relevant to ASD:

* **Level 1: Match My Feelings:** Match a facial expression to the corresponding emotion.
* **Level 2: How Would You Feel?:** Choose the emoji that represents the feeling depicted in a scenario.
* **Level 3: Spot & Click:** Find and tap a specific object within a larger image.
* **Level 4: Stack the Blocks:** Arrange blocks in size order from largest to smallest.
* **Level 5: Bubble Burst:** Pop as many bubbles as possible within a time limit.

**Important Notes for Parents/Clinicians:**

* **Supervision Required:**  A grown-up should supervise the child during all levels, observing their gameplay and providing assistance if needed.
* **Not a Diagnosis:**  This game is a support tool, not a diagnostic instrument.  A formal diagnosis must be made by a qualified healthcare professional.
